I need you to extract the physical site address(es) from the text of this planning application
that was sent to the Burdekin Shire Council, QLD (Queensland) Australia.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Find ONLY the physical site/property address that the planning application concerns,
  which will be within the boundaries of the shire.
- The addresses should be geocodable so we can search by proximity.
- EXCLUDE addresses of: council, consultants, applicants, builders, architects, lawyers, or other participants, etc.
- Valid addresses must be in a Burdekin Shire suburbs/localities, which are currently:
  airdmillan, airville, alva, ayr, barratta, brandon, carstairs, clare, colevale, cromarty, dalbeg, fredericksfield,
  giru, inkerman, jarvisfield, jerona, kirknie, mcdesme, millaroo, mulgrave, osborne, rangemore, shirbourne,
  wangaratta, wunjunga, home hill, upper haughton, mount kelly, mount surround, mona park, majors creek,
  groper creek, eight mile creek, horseshoe lagoon, rita island, swans lagoon
- Addresses that are in a city/suburb/state/country outside the Burdekin Shire Council, QLD are clearly NOT valid
  and should be ignored!
- Look for COMPLETE addresses including street numbers when available
  (e.g., "834 Keith Venables Road, Upper Haughton" not just "Keith Venables Road")
- ALWAYS include the suburb - many street names exist in multiple cities across Australia
- Some applications may have multiple site addresses (e.g., "239 and 241 Queen St and 42 Bower St, Ayr")
- Check for addresses described as: "site address", "physical address", "site at", "property at", "located at",
  "lots located at", etc.
- Ignore PO boxes, lot numbers without street addresses
- Include state and/or postcode if listed (not always listed in pdf)
- The pdf document name may contain some of the site address but that is not guaranteed.
  Assign a minor confidence boost if the filename contains words that match the extracted address
- Output results FIRST before any text comments!
- Provide concise comments why you selected those addresses, and assigned the confidence levels you did only after the JSON output
- Include confidence percentage (0-100)

SEARCH STRATEGY:
1. PRIORITY: Identify addresses that are clearly the application's site/property address
2. Look for complete street addresses with numbers and suburb
3. Cross-reference multiple mentions to verify consistency

Addresses that you cannot clearly identify as the application's site address should be reported with low confidence
so we can choose to ignore them.

Example addresses:
    "123 Main Street, Ayr",
    "45 Queen Street, Home Hill QLD",
    "834 Keith Venables Road, Upper Haughton QLD 4850",
    "26 WEBBER ROAD, MCDESME",
    "78 Station Road, Giru"

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON with example data):

{
  "addresses": [
    {
      "address": "60 Railway Street, Ayr",
      "confidence": 95.2
    }
  ]
}

If no valid site address is found, return: {"addresses": []}
